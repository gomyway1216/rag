---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author likely found that there wasn't enough time when she joined college because the new environment probably presented a more demanding schedule than she had anticipated. With academic responsibilities, extracurricular activities, social commitments, and possibly part-time work, balancing these could lead to a feeling of insufficient time. This is a common experience for many new college students who need to adjust to a more rigorous and self-directed pace of learning, compared to their previous educational experiences.

---------- Qeuestion 6 ----------
How much was the author able to concentrate to the lecture compared to her peers?
---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
I am frequently asked how I overcome the peculiar conditions under which I work in college. In the classroom I am of course practically alone. The professor is as remote as if he were speaking through a telephone. The lectures are spelled into my hand as rapidly as possible, and much of the individuality of the lecturer is lost to me in the effort to keep in the race. The words rush through my hand like hounds in pursuit of a hare which they often miss. But in this respect I do not think I am much worse off than the girls who take notes. If the mind is occupied with the mechanical process of hearing and putting words on paper at pell-mell speed, I should not think one could pay much attention to the subject under consideration or the manner in which it is presented. I cannot make notes during the lectures, because my hands are busy listening. Usually I jot down what I can remember of them when I get home. I write the exercises, daily themes, criticisms and hour-tests, the mid-year and final examinations, on my typewriter, so that the professors have no difficulty in finding out how little I know. When I began the study of Latin prosody, I devised and explained to my professor a system of signs indicating the different meters and quantities.
---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author suggests that her ability to concentrate on the lecture is not much worse than her peers who take notes. She explains that the mechanical process of listening and taking notes at a fast pace likely hampers their ability to pay full attention to the subject and the manner of presentation, similar to her experience. Although she receives the lectures through a unique and rapid method (spelled into her hand), she likens the challenge of concentrating to that faced by other students involved in note-taking.

---------- Qeuestion 7 ----------
In one word, what does the author use to write down? Was this important to her?
---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
But college is not the universal Athens I thought it was. There one does not meet the great and the wise face to face; one does not even feel their living touch. They are there, it is true; but they seem mummified. We must extract them from the crannied wall of learning and dissect and analyze them before we can be sure that we have a Milton or an Isaiah, and not merely a clever imitation. Many scholars forget, it seems to me, that our enjoyment of the great works of literature depends more upon the depth of our sympathy than upon our understanding. The trouble is that very few of their laborious explanations stick in the memory. The mind drops them as a branch drops its overripe fruit. It is possible to know a flower, root and stem and all, and all the processes of growth, and yet to have no appreciation of the flower fresh bathed in heaven's dew. Again and again I ask impatiently, "Why concern myself with these explanations and hypotheses?" They fly hither and thither in my thought like blind birds beating the air with ineffectual wings. I do not mean to object to a thorough knowledge of the famous works we read. I object only to the interminable comments and bewildering criticisms that teach but one thing: there are as many opinions as there are men. But when a great scholar like Professor Kittredge interprets what the master said, it is "as if new sight were given the blind." He brings back Shakespeare, the poet.
---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author uses "sympathy" as a key concept in the passage. Yes, it was important to her, as she emphasizes that our enjoyment of great literary works depends more on the depth of our sympathy rather than just understanding.

What makes her jealous about other girls?

---------- Answer to the question ----------
The passage doesn't provide specific details about what might make her jealous of other girls. However, it suggests a sense of disillusionment and the fading of idealistic dreams upon encountering the reality of college. It's possible that the narrator's feelings of jealousy could stem from observing other girls who seem to navigate college life or its challenges more effortlessly or who may have experiences that align more closely with the narrator's initial expectations.

What did the author like about the composition class in her second year?
---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
Last year, my second year at Radcliffe, I studied English composition, the Bible as English composition, the governments of America and Europe, the Odes of Horace, and Latin comedy. The class in composition was the pleasantest. It was very lively. The lectures were always interesting, vivacious, witty; for the instructor, Mr. Charles Townsend Copeland, more than any one else I have had until this year, brings before you literature in all its original freshness and power. For one short hour you are permitted to drink in the eternal beauty of the old masters without needless interpretation or exposition. You revel in their fine thoughts. You enjoy with all your soul the sweet thunder of the Old Testament, forgetting the existence of Jahweh and Elohim; and you go home feeling that you have had "a glimpse of that perfection in which spirit and form dwell in immortal harmony; truth and beauty bearing a new growth on the ancient stem of time."
---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author liked the composition class in her second year because it was lively and interesting.

---------- Qeuestion 11 ----------
What does the author mean when she says "overtaxed mind cannot enjoy the treasure it has secured at the greatest cost"?
---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
There are, however, times when I long to sweep away half the things I am expected to learn; for the overtaxed mind cannot enjoy the treasure it has secured at the greatest cost. It is impossible, I think, to read in one day four or five different books in different languages and treating of widely different subjects, and not lose sight of the very ends for which one reads. When one reads hurriedly and nervously, having in mind written tests and examinations, one's brain becomes encumbered with a lot of choice bric-a-brac for which there seems to be little use. At the present time my mind is so full of heterogeneous matter that I almost despair of ever being able to put it in order. Whenever I enter the region that was the kingdom of my mind I feel like the proverbial bull in the china shop. A thousand odds and ends of knowledge come crashing about my head like hailstones, and when I try to escape them, theme-goblins and college nixies of all sorts pursue me, until I wish—oh, may I be forgiven the wicked wish!—that I might smash the idols I came to worship.
---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author is expressing the idea that when the mind is overwhelmed with too much information and learning, particularly under pressure, it becomes difficult to truly appreciate and benefit from that knowledge. The "treasure" refers to the valuable insights and understanding gained from studying, but if the mind is "overtaxed," or overloaded, it cannot properly enjoy or make use of these gains. The "greatest cost" signifies the effort and energy expended in acquiring such knowledge. Essentially, the author is lamenting that excessive and hurried learning can diminish the value and enjoyment of the knowledge acquired.

What is Huss an example of?
---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
"Give a brief account of Huss and his work." Huss? Who was he and what did he do? The name looks strangely familiar. You ransack your budget of historic facts much as you would hunt for a bit of silk in a rag-bag. You are sure it is somewhere in your mind near the top—you saw it there the other day when you were looking up the beginnings of the Reformation. But where is it now? You fish out all manner of odds and ends of knowledge—revolutions, schisms, massacres, systems of government; but Huss—where is he? You are amazed at all the things you know which are not on the examination paper. In desperation you seize the budget and dump everything out, and there in a corner is your man, serenely brooding on his own private thought, unconscious of the catastrophe which he has brought upon you.
---------- Answer to the question ----------
Huss is an example of a historical figure associated with early efforts at reforming the church, preceding the Protestant Reformation. Jan Hus (often anglicized as John Huss) was a Czech theologian and philosopher who became a key predecessor to the Protestant movement of the 16th century. He was a significant figure in the Western Schism and was known for advocating church reform, criticizing various practices of the Catholic Church, and emphasizing the authority of the Bible over that of the church hierarchy. His work laid the groundwork for future reformers such as Martin Luther. Huss was eventually excommunicated and burned at the stake for heresy in 1415. His life and teachings serve as an important example of the challenges faced by early reformers within the church.

How did the author feel when she took an exam?
---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
But the examinations are the chief bugbears of my college life. Although I have faced them many times and cast them down and made them bite the dust, yet they rise again and menace me with pale looks, until like Bob Acres I feel my courage oozing out at my finger ends. The days before these ordeals take place are spent in cramming your mind with mystic formula and indigestible dates—unpalatable diets, until you wish that books and science and you were buried in the depths of the sea.
---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author felt anxious and discouraged when she took an exam. She compared the exams to "bugbears" and described the experience as an ordeal, causing her courage to "ooze out." The preparation involved cramming her mind with difficult and unappealing information, leading to a desire to escape from the burden of it all.

What is one lesson that the author learned through attending college?
---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
I began my studies with eagerness. Before me I saw a new world opening in beauty and light, and I felt within me the capacity to know all things. In the wonderland of Mind I should be as free as another. Its people, scenery, manners, joys, tragedies should be living, tangible interpreters of the real world. The lecture-halls seemed filled with the spirit of the great and the wise, and I thought the professors were the embodiment of wisdom. If I have since learned differently, I am not going to tell anybody.
---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author learned that the professors and college experience, initially perceived as embodiments of wisdom, may not entirely align with that perception upon closer experience and reflection.

What should the author do to improve her life?
---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
Very few of the books required in the various courses are printed for the blind, and I am obliged to have them spelled into my hand. Consequently I need more time to prepare my lessons than other girls. The manual part takes longer, and I have perplexities which they have not. There are days when the close attention I must give to details chafes my spirit, and the thought that I must spend hours reading a few chapters, while in the world without other girls are laughing and singing and dancing, makes me rebellious; but I soon recover my buoyancy and laugh the discontent out of my heart. For, after all, every one who wishes to gain true knowledge must climb the Hill Difficulty alone, and since there is no royal road to the summit, I must zigzag it in my own way. I slip back many times, I fall, I stand still, I run against the edge of hidden obstacles, I lose my temper and find it again and keep it better, I trudge on, I gain a little, I feel encouraged, I get more eager and climb higher and begin to see the widening horizon. Every struggle is a victory. One more effort and I reach the luminous cloud, the blue depths of the sky, the uplands of my desire. I am not always alone, however, in these struggles. Mr. William Wade and Mr. E. E. Allen, Principal of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, get for me many of the books I need in raised print. Their thoughtfulness has been more of a help and encouragement to me than they can ever know.
---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author could consider a few strategies to improve her life:

1. **Balance Work and Leisure**: While studying is important, taking breaks and allowing time for social activities could help alleviate feelings of being left out when others are enjoying themselves.

2. **Leverage Available Resources**: She should continue to utilize support from individuals like Mr. William Wade and Mr. E. E. Allen who help her access books in raised print, ensuring she's using all available resources to ease her learning process.

3. **Seek Peer Support**: Engaging with others who might have similar experiences or challenges could provide additional emotional support and practical advice.

4. **Set Realistic Goals**: By setting achievable milestones, she can maintain motivation and a sense of accomplishment even if progress feels slow.

5. **Self-Care Practices**: Implementing mindful practices and self-care routines can help manage stress and maintain her spirit and enthusiasm for learning.

6. **Explore Technological Solutions**: With advancements in technology, there might be tools and software that could aid her studies and improve efficiency.

7. **Celebrate Small Victories**: Acknowledging and celebrating each small success can foster a positive outlook and continued motivation. 

By focusing on these areas, she can work towards achieving a more fulfilling and balanced life while pursuing her education.
