But college is not the universal Athens I thought it was. There one does not meet the great and the wise face to face; one does not even feel their living touch.

---------- Answer to the question ----------
Yes, the author seems to express disappointment with her college experience. She anticipated college to be a place where she would encounter the great and wise in a vibrant and personal way, but instead found that these figures seemed distant and lifeless, almost like "mummified" entities. The author felt the need to actively extract, dissect, and analyze them to truly understand their significance, suggesting a gap between her expectations and the reality she faced.

---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author believed there was not enough time in college because the demands and responsibilities of academic life, such as attending classes, completing assignments, and engaging in various activities, often leave little room for leisure and personal reflection. This busy schedule can make it difficult to find moments of quiet and introspection necessary for communing with one's thoughts or enjoying personal interests, such as reading poetry.

I cannot make notes during the lectures, because my hands are busy listening. Usually I jot down what I can remember of them when I get home. I write the exercises, dai
---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author suggests that it is challenging to concentrate on the lecture due to the fast pace at which it is delivered. The author experiences additional difficulty because their hands are occupied with "listening," likely referring to the use of Braille or other tactile methods to understand the lecture content. This indicates that they might be at a disadvantage compared to their peers, who can perhaps more easily take notes during the lecture. The author compensates for this by jotting down what they can remember after returning home.

What does the author mean when she says "overtaxed mind cannot enjoy the treasure it has secured at the greatest cost"?
---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
s. I suppose I ought to find some comfort in the thought that I am laying up treasures for future enjoyment, but I am improvident enough to prefer present joy to hoarding riches against a rainy day.
---------- Answer to the question ----------
When the author says "overtaxed mind cannot enjoy the treasure it has secured at the greatest cost," she is suggesting that if one's mind is overworked or stressed, it will not be able to appreciate or enjoy the benefits or rewards (the "treasure") that have been achieved through hard work or sacrifice. The phrase implies that mental exhaustion or stress can diminish one's ability to find satisfaction or joy in accomplishments, regardless of how valuable or significant they may be. Essentially, the author's message is a reminder of the importance of mental well-being in enjoying life's successes.

---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
"Give a brief account of Huss and his work." Huss? Who was he and what did he do? The name looks strangely familiar. You ransack your budget of historic facts much as you would hunt for a bit of silk
---------- Answer to the question ----------
Huss is an example of a historical figure prominent in the context of religious reform. Jan Hus (also spelled John Huss) was a Czech theologian and philosopher who became a church reformer and is considered a key predecessor to Protestantism. He was a master at Charles University in Prague and became known for his criticism of the Catholic Church's practices, particularly the sale of indulgences. Hus advocated for reform along lines of the teachings of John Wycliffe, emphasizing scripture as the ultimate authority in matters of faith. His efforts to challenge the Church's authority eventually led to his excommunication and execution by burning at the stake in 1415, making him a martyr for emerging Protestant movements and a symbol for subsequent reformers, such as Martin Luther.

---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author, Helen Keller, felt a sense of self-awareness and perhaps some self-deprecation when taking exams. In her writing, she often joked about how her written exams clearly demonstrated her lack of knowledge on certain subjects to her professors. This suggests she may have felt a mix of anxiety, humility, and humor during examinations.
