I had taken to heart the words of the wise Roman who said, "To be banished from Rome is but to live outside of Rome." Debarred from the great highways of knowledge, I was compelled to make the journey across country by unfrequented roads—that was all; and I knew that in college there were many bypaths where I could touch hands with girls who were thinking, loving and struggling like me

---------- Qeuestion 11 ----------
What does the author mean when she says "overtaxed mind cannot enjoy the treasure it has secured at the greatest cost"?
---------- Retrieved text from the database ----------
ghts. One goes to college to learn, it seems, not to think. When one enters the portals of learning, one leaves the dearest pleasures—solitude, books and imagination—outside with the whispering pines. I suppose I ought to find some comfort in the thought that I am laying up treasures for future enjoyment, but I am improvident enough to prefer present joy to hoarding riches against a rainy day.
---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author suggests that when a mind is overworked or burdened with too much information or stress, it cannot fully appreciate or benefit from the knowledge or experiences it has gained, even if acquiring that knowledge came at a significant effort or cost. Essentially, the mental strain diminishes the capacity to enjoy or make use of what has been learned or achieved.

What is Huss an example of?

"Give a brief account of Huss and his work." Huss? Who was he and what did he do? The name looks strangely familiar. You ransack your budget of historic facts much as you would hunt for a bit of silk in a rag-bag. You are sure it is somewhere in your mind near the top—you saw it there the other day when you were looking up the beginnings of the Reformation. But where is it now? You fish out all m
---------- Answer to the question ----------
Huss is an example of an early reformer in the Christian church, specifically within the context of the pre-Reformation era. Jan Hus, a Czech theologian and priest, was a significant figure who challenged the practices and doctrines of the Catholic Church in the early 15th century. His calls for reform and critiques of church corruption laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation that would follow in the 16th century. Huss's teachings and martyrdom (he was burned at the stake in 1415) exemplify the tensions and conflicts that arose from calls for religious reform and the eventual radical changes in Christianity during that period.

I slip back many times, I fall, I stand still, I run against the edge of hidden obstacles, I lose my temper and find it again and keep it better, I trudge on, I gain a little, I feel encouraged, I get more eager and climb higher and begin to see the widening horizon. Every struggle is a victory. One more effort and I reach the luminous cloud, the blue depths of the sky, the uplands of my desire. I am not always alone, however, in these struggles.

Very few of the books required in the various courses are printed for the blind, and I am obliged to have them spelled into my hand. Consequently I need more time to prepare my lessons than other girls. The manual part takes longer, and I have perplexities which they have not. There are days when the close attention I must give to details chafes my spirit, and the thought that I must spend hours reading a few chapters, while in the world without other girls are laughing and singing and dancing, makes me rebellious; but I soon recover my buoyancy and laugh the discontent out of my heart.

---------- Answer to the question ----------
The author could consider several approaches to improve her life, focusing on enhancing her study methods, managing her emotions, and embracing community. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Seek Assistive Technology:** Exploring modern assistive technologies designed for the visually impaired may help her study more efficiently. Tools like screen readers, voice-to-text software, or braille e-readers can significantly reduce the time and effort required to study.

2. **Time Management Strategies:** Developing effective time management techniques can help her maximize her study time and balance it with leisure activities. Prioritizing tasks and breaking down her workload into manageable parts could alleviate some of the pressure.

3. **Emotional Support and Counseling:** Finding a mentor, joining support groups, or seeking counseling could help her process feelings of frustration and rebelliousness. Sharing experiences with others who face similar challenges might also provide comfort and motivation.

4. **Community Involvement:** Engaging more with her community and peers might help her feel less isolated. This could include joining clubs, participating in group activities, or social events that accommodate her needs.

5. **Adaptation and Flexibility:** Cultivating resilience and a positive outlook can help her navigate her difficulties. Embracing her unique journey and finding joy in small victories can contribute to a more fulfilling life experience. 

By adopting some of these strategies, the author could potentially improve her overall quality of life, balancing academics with personal happiness.
