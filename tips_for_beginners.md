# Tips for very beginners to work on this project
This is for **very beginners** like me ðŸ˜Š  

Experienced members helped me to get to this point. 
Please correct me if anything is wrong!


## Tools
- Postman: API platform
- Docker Desktop: Environment for your project to run on
- Visual Studio Code: Write your code here
- GitHub: Manage your code here
- Ruff and Black: check and format your code
- Pytest: A framework for test cases


## Steps
### Open tools and terminal windows
Visual Studio Code, Postman, Docker Desktop, three terminal windows
### Build your virtual environment using docker
1. In a terminal window, go to your project's directory (rag directory in our case)
2. `docker compose up --build`
### Keep your files up to date through GitHub
1. In the second terminal window, go to your project's directory (rag directory)
2. `git branch` see what branches are there and check which branch you are in
3. `git switch main` go to the main branch
4. `git pull` keep your files up to date
5. `git branch new-branch-name` make a new branch out of a main branch. You will be working in this branch.
6. `git status` if you want to check your current status
### Run a python file
1. In the third terminal window, go to your project's directory (rag directory)
2. `docker exec -it fastapi sh` start using the virtual environment (container)
3. You see many #s. Don't be surprised ðŸ˜‰
4. `python3 path_to_your_file/your_python_file.py` now you can see your file running! Yay!
### Save your progress and updating it in GitHub
0. Suppose you made changes to `your_python_file.py`
1. In the second terminal window, where you operated `git` commands,
2. Check and clean your code first by doing: `ruff check your_python_file.py` and `black your_python_file.py`
3. `git add your_python_file.py` to say you want to get this file updated (alternatively, use `git add -u` when you've deleted files. This command adds the difference for you automatically, including the files you deleted.)
4. `git commit -m "describe the changes I made"` to confirm that those you added are the ones you want to update.
5. `git push` to get your updates reflected on GitHub (If they provide a longer command for you to copy-paste, do so.)
6. Go to your GitHub page
7. Once you check the difference, if that is good, proceed to make a pull request
8. If the difference is not okay, make changes to your files and follow steps 2 to 5 again.
9. When making a pull request, assign Assignees, reviewers, and labels.

### Run test cases
0. Implement code for test cases
    1. Go to Postman
    2. Choose HTML method (eg: POST)
    3. enter URL next to it (eg: localhost:8000/bmi) <!-- is it called URL? -->
    (You specified your URL in your other file like this above your function: ```@router.post("/bmi", response_model=BMIResponse, status_code=200)```)
    4. Type your variables into the Body section
    5. Send and get the results 
    6. Copy-paste those to your test cases' code (eg: test_health.py)
    7. Refer to https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html for writing code for test cases
1. Make sure your Docker is up
2. ```docker exec -it fastapi pytest```


Alternatively,

0. Implement code for test cases
1. Make sure your Docker is up
2. Go to Docker Desktop App
3. Choose FastAPI and open Exec tab
4. Go to your project's directory (rag directory)
5. ```pytest path_to_your_file/your_python_file.py``` and now you see your test results!
(eg: ```pytest app/tests/api/routes/test_health.py```)
