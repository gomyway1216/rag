# Neural Networks Basics

## What are neural networks?
Neural networks are the base structure used in most machine learning methods. \
The basic structure consists of an **input layer, hidden layer(s), and  output layer**, as illustrated below. The network is **deeper** when there are **more hidden layers**.

Circles represent **neurons** and lines represent **neural connections**.

In this figure, there are 2 neurons for the input layer, 4 for each hidden layer, and 1 for the output layer.
The network is **fully connected**, meaning that all neurons in a layer are connected to all neurons in the next layer.



## The basic concept of applying neural networks
Think of a neural network as complex and simple representations to **replace a mathematical function**. \
They are **complex** in that they use **way too many variables** than a mathematical formula can express. \
They are **simple** in that this one structure can **express many kinds of functions**.
It is illustrated in Figure 2.

## Prediction using neural networks
The use of neural networks is mostly either prediction (regression) or classification. \
As illustrated in Figure 3, one famous **prediction use case** is the **prediction of future stock market trends** using past trends. (time series prediction)

## Classification using neural networks
Another use of neural networks is classification. \
As illustrated in Figure 4, one famous **classification use case** is **image classification**.
